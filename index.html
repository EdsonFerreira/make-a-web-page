          <h3 id="lesson-1-1">The Web Page and The Web</h3>
            <p>
              A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML.
              Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.<br>
              The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
              with each other. When a person goes to a web
              page like <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
              server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
              it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
              interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-1-2">What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>
              HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
              Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
              content on the web.
            </p> 
            <p>
              HTML documents contain <em>text
              content</em> which describes "what you see" and
              <em>markup</em> which describes
              "how it looks".         <br> 
              <em>HTML Mark up</em>, is made up of <b>elements</b>, and <b>tags</b>   
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-1-3">What are Elements and Tags</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Elements</b> are the format in which HTML code is written. An element contains the following an opening tag, the contents of the tag, and the closing tag.         <br>
              Elements also come in two different forms<em>In-line elements, and Block elements.</em>The difference between the two, is that block elements put a invisible box around the text, whereas in-line elements do not do this.         <br>
              <b>Tags</b> are the commands used to format a page, they are usually contained within angled brackets. There are 2 types of tags the first type is a tag that has an opening and closing tag, and there is another type of tag called a <em>void tag</em>. They are tags that only have an opening tag such as the break tag. whereas the paragraph tag would be a normal tag.
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-1-4">Inline Elements & Block Elements:</h3>
            <p>
              Elements in HTML are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
              elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
              them.
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-1-5">Are computers stupid?</h3>
            <p>
              Computers are stupid because they interpret
              instructions literally. This makes them very
              unforgiving since a small mistake by a
              programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

          <h3 id="lesson-2-1">Browser Developer Tools</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Every</b> browser that you encounter will most likely contain some sort of way for developers to see the code is behind the web page that is being displayed. If you use chrome like I do then all you have to do is hit your F12 key on your keyboard. This will bring up the Developer Console, which will allow you to see the code that is behind the page your on, it will also show you this in a tree like structure with arrows that show and hide different parts of the page. I will talk about this more in another part of this lesson's notes
            </p>  
          <h3 id="lesson-2-2">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h3>
            <p>
              The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
              elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
              draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
              had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-2-3">What is a DOM?</h3>
            <p>
              DOM stands for <em>Document Object Model</em>. It is basically the tree structure talked about earlier. It represents they way your HTML code is organized, and how your code is represented in the developer console. If your code is organized then your code should be very easy to read and understand. Examples of this may be the div tag which puts a box around each part of your code that you want to keep organized. Each of these boxes are labeled with a class tag within each div element.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
              of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
              inside of boxes, and so on...
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-2-4">The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h3>
            <p>
              When you read an HTML document as
              <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
              changing indentations going up and down the left side
              of the document. The more indented an element is, the
              more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-2-5">Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
             <p>
               When writing code, programmers use special text editors
               (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
               programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
               will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
               write an opening tag.

          <h3 id="lesson-3-1">Avoiding Repetition</h3>
            <p>
              Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
            </p>
          <h3 id="lesson-3-2">What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>
              CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em>, and it is a styling language. It is used for defining the look and feel of an HTML page, and it does this by using syntax tools.
